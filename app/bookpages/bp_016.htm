    <p>a. &nbsp;Start in the supine position (lying on back). Grab the right knee and start to bring it toward the
        chest.
    </p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Using the strength of the arms, bring the knee as close to the chest as possible. Do not attempt to
        touch the nose to the knee.
    </p>

    <p>c. &nbsp;This is a separate exercise of slowly touching the nose to knee. It is used for measurement. Avoid, if
        you have any neck problems.
    </p>

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Repeat the same process for the left leg.</li>
        <li>When comfortable with the “Knee to Chest”, measure with the “Nose to Knee” stretch. Upon being able to touch
            the “Nose to Knee” you are ready for some of the Intermediate Therapeutic Program.
