    <h3>1. KNEELING CHEST TO KNEE - ERECTOR SPINAE STRETCH</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/Opti-Stretch-ebook/Image_023.png">

    <p>a. &nbsp;Wide stance kneeling starting position. Toes should be pointing straight back. Buttocks should be
        resting on the heels.</p>

    <p>b. &nbsp;Fetal position curl. Attempt to place the chest gently to the thighs and forehead between the knees.</p>
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>This is a relaxing position to begin warming-up the low back. It can be eliminated if time is short.</li>
        <li>This is the same as the “Kneeling Nose to Floor”. The major difference is that you should not try to flex
            the neck to the floor. This can be too strenuous for certain individuals.
        </li>
        <li>This again should be a comfortable warm-up stretch. If you find it uncomfortable do not perform this
            stretch.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Risk factors:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> If unable to get the nose 4 inches above the knees, this suggests a possible limitation in normal range of
            motion for flexion of the spine.
        </li>
        <li>If unable to comfortably place the chest onto the knees suggests there may be some difficulty in performing
            the stretching exercise of “Sitting Nose to Knee” (Figure Four).
        </li>
    </ol>
